##Before testing
The samples provided are unsigned so this will cause the the signature check (built into CEP when first running an extension) to fail. To bypass the signature check, edit the CSXS preference properties file and add a new entry `PlayerDebugMode` of type "string" with the value of "1". This enables debug extensions to be displayed in the host applications. The CSXS preferences properties file is located at:
```
Mac: /Users/<username>/Library/Preferences/com.adobe.CSXS.5.plist
Win: regedit > HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Adobe/CSXS.5
```
